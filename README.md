#Network-Construction

Functions for creating complex neural network structures with ease. 

__linear\_struct(in\_shape,conv\_layers,FC\_layers,\*args,\*\*kwargs)__: This is the based constructor of all other networks. All networks are either wholly or partially comprised of linear blocks of convolution layers. It is mainly designed to be able to produce models for image classifiers, but need not necessarily do so as it can also be used for regression models and 

__branched\_struct():__
